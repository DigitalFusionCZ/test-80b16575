      "description": "The primary logo for the VŠE PRO STAVBY.CZ website, featuring the company name in white, likely intended for use against darker backgrounds or as a standalone identity mark. The current dimensions (1024x609) are likely larger than needed for typical logo display, suggesting it might be used at a reduced size.",
      "suggested_usage": "Resize and optimize for web. Use as the main site logo in the header/navigation. Consider creating an SVG version for scalability. Ensure proper alt text is added for accessibility, e.g., 'VŠE PRO STAVBY.CZ logo'.",
